Issue #1 on GitHub ...

Hi,
First of all, thanks for this nice piece of code :)
My idea, is to mess with email addreses a bit. Presenting them in a form like "user at domain dot com" or just "user at domain.com" isn't really less readable than the standard form, yet it might save our spamfilters some work.

Kind regards,
Ted
